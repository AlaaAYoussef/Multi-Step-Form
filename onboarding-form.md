To address the requirement of storing the onboarding form data in the database instead of returning hardcoded data, we can make several changes to the existing database structure and data handling procedures.
The proposed solution involves the following steps:

1. make changes to the database schema :-

   - Firstly, it is necessary to create a new table called "OnboardingForm," specifically designed to store the onboarding form data.
   - This table should have columns that align with the various fields in the onboarding form, such as name, email, address, and so on.
   - Each column should be assigned an appropriate data type and constraints based on the expected data.

2. Make modification on the API endpoint :-

   - The next step involves updating the GET /api/onboarding endpoint to retrieve data from the newly created "OnboardingForm" table in the database.
   - The logic of the endpoint needs to be modified so that it fetches the relevant data from the database instead of returning hardcoded values.
   - Additionally, the endpoint should be configured to return the retrieved data in a suitable format, such as JSON, enabling easy consumption by the client application.

3. Saving User's Responses:-

   - When a user submits the onboarding form, their responses should be sent to a new API endpoint, for example, POST /api/onboarding.
   - Extracting the user's responses from the request payload, it is essential to validate the data to ensure it meets the required criteria.
   - Once the data has been validated, it should be inserted into the "OnboardingForm" table in the database.
   - Proper error handling mechanisms should be in place to handle any potential errors during the insertion process, providing appropriate feedback to the user.

4. make Data Validation and Sanitization:-

   - To maintain data integrity and prevent malicious input, it is crucial to implement validation checks on the user's responses.
   - Each field should be validated based on its expected format, length, and any specific rules, such as email format or address validation.
   - Additionally, it is important to sanitize the input data to mitigate the risk of SQL injection or other security vulnerabilities.

5. Data Privacy and Security:

   - To ensure the security of stored data, appropriate security measures must be implemented.
   - Sensitive user information, such as passwords or financial details, should be encrypted before being stored in the database.
   - Following industry best practices, passwords should be hashed using a strong algorithm, and secure connections (HTTPS) should be used for data transmission.

6. Error Handling and Logging:

   - Robust error handling mechanisms should be in place to capture and log any errors encountered during data retrieval or storage processes.
   - Logging relevant information, such as timestamps, error messages, and request details, will facilitate debugging and troubleshooting efforts.

7. Backup and Recovery:

   - Establishing a backup strategy is crucial to ensure data durability and provide a recovery mechanism in case of accidental data loss or system failures.
   - Regularly backing up the database to a secure and separate location, following industry best practices, is highly recommended.
